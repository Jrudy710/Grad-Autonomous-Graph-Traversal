The repository will house 3 programs:
  1) The First Program:
        A program that will create a 2-d representation of a graph using the directions (N, NE, NW, E, SE, S, SW, W) and the colors of red and blue.
        This program will also make it so the program will either make both graphs that have the ability to be navigated to a terminal point, and graphs that can be made with no way to reach their endpoint.

  2) The Second Program:
        A program that will when given a file, will run the different graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy, and A*) and store the results (How long it took to compute the path, or lack thereof) for each graph
  
  3) The Third Program:
       A Program that will make sure that the path that was computed in the previous program leads to the correct terminal position
